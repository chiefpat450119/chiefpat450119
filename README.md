### Hi, I'm Patrick, a CS undergraduate at the University of British Columbia.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on maintaining my current projects (python scripts).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS and Javascript to create a personal website.
- I'm interested in getting into game development.
- I *really* need to learn JS and web development frameworks.
